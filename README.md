## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mj2603/financial-news-nlp.git
cd financial-news-nlp
```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure the NLP models:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```python
from nlp_pipeline import FinancialNewsPipeline
from sentiment_visuals import SentimentVisualizer

# Initialize the pipeline with your API credentials
pipeline = FinancialNewsPipeline(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

# Collect and analyze news data
news_df = pipeline.collect_news("AAPL", days=30)
processed_df = pipeline.process_news(news_df)

# Generate market analysis
market_data = pipeline.get_market_data("AAPL")

# Launch the analysis dashboard
visualizer = SentimentVisualizer()
app = visualizer.create_dashboard(processed_df)
app.run_server(debug=False, port=8050)
```

### Production Deployment

For production environments, we recommend:
- Using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx)
- Implementing proper authentication
- Setting up SSL certificates
- Using a production-grade database
- Implementing proper logging and monitoring
